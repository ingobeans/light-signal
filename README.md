## about

this is a small horror-esque game i made for hackclub's siege! i made it in godot, and this is my first ever 3D game so that pretty cool!

i have made all the models myself, but most of the textures have been sourced from the internet. all of the code is either written by me or joinked from stackoverflow or reddit. NO AI :3

the game takes place on an island with a lighthouse, the goal being to use the lighthouse to signal for help.

## controls

WASD for movement and mouse to look around.
